The Recipe Notebook is an online notebook that allows you to search for different meals using ingredients or a recipe. The user can click on a specific letter of the alphabet to find meals starting with that letter or alternatively browse the meal options letter by letter. Once a specific meal has been selected a new page will open which displays the ingredients needed to prepare the meal selected, instructions on how to prepare the selected meal, as well as a YouTube video displaying how to prepare the meal.

I used React.js, React Hooks, React-Router-Dom, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a REST API to create this project.
